MVC is abbreviated as Model View Controller is a design pattern created for developing applications specifically web applications.
As the name suggests, it has three major parts.
The traditional software design pattern works in an "Input - Process - Output" pattern whereas MVC works as "Controller -Model - View" approach.
With the emergence of the MVC model, creation of application takes different aspects individually into consideration. These aspects of the application are:

UI Logic

Input logic

Business Logic


#But there is a loose coupling between these aspects or elements.
According to this model, each element needs to exist in an application but not tightly connected or interlinked.
The UI logic deals with the view or front end of the application.
The Input logic deals with the controller. Lastly, business logic deals with the model of an application.
This loosely coupled element helps developers handle development complication when building any application.
It helps users' enables in focus on one specific element of the implementation at a time. Take a scenario where you are working with business;
you can specifically deal with that and focus on the business logic building without depending on the view logic.
